# CourseraBuildingRPckg


This package is built for the Peer Assignement of [Building R Package Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages/home/welcome).

The goal of the package is to help you *process* and *plot* data downloaded from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars) about fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes in the US.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CourseraBuildingRPckg from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Capucine0210/CourseraProject")
```

## Functions

There are two main functions to process and plot FARS data:

* `fars_summarize_years()` summarizes FARS report accidents by month and year in a tibble

* `fars_map_state()` plots all accident locations for a given year on a US federal state map
